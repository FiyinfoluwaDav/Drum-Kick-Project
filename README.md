##  Description

This project is a simple yet engaging drum kit application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play various drum sounds by either clicking on the corresponding drum pads on the screen or by pressing the associated keys on their keyboard. The application also features a "combo" effect that is triggered when a certain number of keys are pressed within a short amount of time, adding a fun and rewarding element to the user experience.

##  Features

*   **Interactive Drum Pads:** Click on the drum pads to play different drum sounds.
*   **Keyboard Support:** Use your keyboard to play the drums. The keys 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', and 'l' are mapped to different drum sounds.
*   **Visual Feedback:** When a drum pad is played, it visually changes to provide feedback to the user.
*   **Combo Effect:** A "combo" effect is triggered when you press 10 keys within 4 seconds, displaying a fiery "🔥 Combo! 🔥" message on the screen.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout of the drum kit is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
